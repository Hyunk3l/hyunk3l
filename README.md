## Repositories

Here are some repos I'm especially proud of:
- [Hexagonal Architecture template in Kotlin](https://github.com/Hyunk3l/hexagonal-architecture-kotlin-template): a template of a Spring Boot app in Kotlin, using Ports & Adapter architecture. It also follows the Application, Domain, Infrastructure packages structure.
- [Ecommerce simulation](https://github.com/Hyunk3l/ecommerce/tree/main): an ecommerce divided in different Bounded Contexts / Services, made with Kotlin, Spring Boot, etc. It's still WIP, I try to continue the development from time to time.
